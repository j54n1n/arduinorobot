# Unit Testing IntegerEasyTransfer library

Tests tests are written using the
[ArduinoUnit library version 2.2.0](https://github.com/mmurdoch/arduinounit).

Follow the instructions in the ArduinoUnit readme to install the library.

Compile and upload the test sketch as you would any other sketch. Then open the
Serial Monitor to view the test results.

If you make changes to the IntegerEasyTransfer library, run the tests in /tests/
to ensure that your changes have not produced any unexpected errors.

You should also perform manual tests against actual hardware.
